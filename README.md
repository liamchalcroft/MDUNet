This repo contains code used for submission to the MICCAI 2022 BrainLes ISLES and ATLAS challenges. The repo was originally a fork of the NVIDIA nnUNet implementation (https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/tree/master/PyTorch/Segmentation/nnUNet) and so the structure / format is heavily based on this, and it is recommended to use their documentation as a first point of contact.
